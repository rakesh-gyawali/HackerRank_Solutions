#  Oracle HR Schema - Complex SQL Practice

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! This project contains a curated collection of ** SQL queries** using **Oracle's built-in HR schema**. These problems includes advanced SQL concepts like:

- Window Functions
- Aggregations & Grouping
- Subqueries & CTEs
- Hierarchical Queries
- Analytical Calculations

##  Schema Reference: Oracle HR

This repo uses the **Oracle HR sample schema**, which includes the following key tables:

- `employees`
- `departments`
- `jobs`
- `locations`
- `countries`
- `regions`

> If you don’t have the HR schema installed, you can [follow Oracle's official guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/comsc/installing-sample-schemas.html) to set it up.
